- sprintf buffer overflow in opj_compress.c/opj_decompress.c (parse_cmdline_encoder)

I opened this issue here: https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg/issues/1129

The Joern query I used to find this issue was:

    getCallsTo("sprintf").filter{ it.ithArguments("1").code.toList()[0].contains("%s") }
    .statements().unsanitized({ it, s -> it.codeContains("strlen") }).dedup()
    .filter{ it.code.contains("char") && it.code.contains("[") && !it.code.contains("strlen")}

Explanation: We get calls to sprintf() where the format string argument contains a %s. We then
use the unsanitized() step to see if any statically allocated char buffers are passed to this
sprintf call. Our definition of "sanitized" here is using "strlen" at any point in the control
flow.  The three statements in the last filter call ensure we are declaring a char buffer on the 
stack, and that we are not using strlen to do so (i.e., we are looking for static char buffers
with a hard-coded length).

Same Joern query as above.
